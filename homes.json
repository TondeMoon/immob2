following text was translated by Google Translate.,Rare fact for the resort of Verbier, this property has the advantage of being on a large plot, on the edge of the building zone. It thus offers owners an impression of intimacy while having a dominant position over the resort and the Alps, a stone's throw from the ski slopes.A view from the outside already makes it possible to become aware of the many advantages of this chalet: the spa, the fitness room and the outdoor swimming pool, heated all year round, constitute a hyphen of well-being between the main chalet, built in old wood, and the outbuilding which has its own access.The visit of the interior reveals an atmosphere and refined and cozy materials, worthy of the most beautiful luxury chalets. The living room offers a breathtaking view: we particularly appreciate the roof under framework, the large bay windows and the majestic and original fireplace, which offer an undeniable cachet to this living room.We discover an industrial-style kitchen, open to the dining room, which lets us easily imagine moments of sharing around the large table, facing the natural picture offered by the mountains.A second closed professional kitchen seems ready to accommodate a chef at home or allows meals to be prepared in a space separate from the living room.The chalet has a parental suite under the frame, very cocooning and 6 other bedrooms each with their own bathroom.When we finish the visit of this extraordinary property, we are captivated by the contemporary alpine design it offers and by its exceptional location.","agency":"AGENCE IMMOBILIERE MICKAEL HOFMANN","agentCity":"Sion","agentAdress":"AGENCE IMMOBILIERE MICKAEL HOFMANN,Rue de Lausanne 79,1950 Sion,,Afficher le numéro de téléphone","businessPhone":"Tél. +41 79 447 42 00","agencyWebSite":"","coords":"46.1073031,7.2233017","link":"https://www.swissfineproperties.com/luxury/master+property-for+sale-verbier-743715.html?pos=48","reference":"REF743715 -

Built around a five hundred year old bell tower and its church, which has recently been renovated, this village has managed to keep its character in its heart where you can still admire some of the old houses as you wander through the narrow streets. Archaeological excavations have also revealed that a large community lived here as early as the 11th century. Attractive thanks to its geographical location and sunshine, this village, which also includes the two hamlets of Cries and Etiez, regularly welcomes new residents. ########It is in the village of Cries that we propose this villa to be built, which is composed as followsBasement: (114.72 m2)- Garage for 2 vehicles- Technical room- Storage room / cellar of 15m2Ground floor : (134.32 m2)- Living room open onto a beautiful garden of 360m2- Fully equipped open kitchen- En-suite master bedroom with shower- Guest toilet- Economat - 11m2 storage room- Terrace of 14.7m2First floor: (81.10 m2)- 3 bedrooms- Bathroom with bath and shower- Mezzanine","agency":"Bagnes Immobilier","agentCity":"Le Châble","agentAdress":"Bagnes Immobilier,Chemin du sommet 1,1934 Le Châble,,Afficher le numéro de téléphone","businessPhone":"Tél. +41 27 565 39 55","agencyWebSite":"","coords":"46.09180316417,7.176","link":"https://www.swissfineproperties.com/luxury/detached+house-for+sale-cries+%28voll%c3%a8ges%29-734038.html?pos=88","reference":"REF734038","livingSq":215,"square":134,"area":1492,"floors":null,"rooms":5.5,"baths":2,"beds":4,"yearBuilt":2022,"yearRenovated":null,"images":["https://media2.publimmo.ch/thumbs/carousel/73/734038/7562859.jpg","https://media2.publimmo.ch/thumbs/carousel/73/734038/7562860.jpg","https://media2.publimmo.ch/thumbs/carousel/73/734038/7562857.jpg","https://media2.publimmo.ch/thumbs/carousel/73/734038/7562858.jpg","https://media2.publimmo.ch/thumbs/carousel/73/734038/7562859.jpg","https://media2.publimmo.ch/thumbs/carousel/73/734038/7562860.jpg","https://media2.publimmo.ch/thumbs/carousel/73/734038/7562857.jpg","https://media2.publimmo.ch/thumbs/carousel/73/734038/7562858.jpg","https://www.swissfineproperties.com/userfiles/ads/pub_publimmo-518x518.gif","https://media2.publimmo.ch/thumbs/sq/66/660302/6819935.jpg","https://media2.publimmo.ch/thumbs/sq/33/331523/3523776.jpg","https://media2.publimmo.ch/thumbs/sq/70/705309/7297417.jpg","https://media2.publimmo.ch/thumbs/sq/34/345452/3744233.jpg","https://media2.publimmo.ch/thumbs/sq/64/645734/6673865.jpg","https://media2.publimmo.ch/thumbs/sq/69/690543/7157112.jpg","https://www.swissfineproperties.com/userfiles/ads/pub_publimmo-518x518.gif","https://media2.publimmo.ch/thumbs/sq/66/660302/6819935.jpg","https://media2.publimmo.ch/thumbs/sq/33/331523/3523776.jpg","https://media2.publimmo.ch/thumbs/sq/70/705309/7297417.jpg","https://media2.publimmo.ch/thumbs/sq/34/345452/3744233.jpg","https://media2.publimmo.ch/thumbs/sq/64/645734/6673865.jpg","https://media2.publimmo.ch/thumbs/sq/69/690543/7157112.jpg","https://www.swissfineproperties.com/userfiles/ads/pub_publimmo-518x518.gif"],"directLink":"","source":"Swiss Fine Properties"}]
